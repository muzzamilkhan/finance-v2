# Finance Project Plan

## Project Overview

A Next.js-based financial application built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

This app will forecase recurring and once-off expenses and income along with a running balance.
The intention is to provide warning when balances are expected to be low or below zero.

- User is prompted to enter current balance.
- Pre-filled number of days set as 90 days, which can be changed.
- A table shows daily incomes and expenses and shows running totals
- Days without any incomes or expenses are hidden
- lowest balance row is highlighted as danger
- negative balance rows are higlighted as warnings
- User can choose to skip the current day
- User can override or skip specific incomes and expenses

### Admin section:

- Manage expenses and incomes

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow functional component patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Write meaningful component and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Git Workflow

- Feature branches should be created from `main`
- Branch naming: `feature/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Pull requests require code review before merging

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Integration tests for complex features
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Test coverage goals: 80%

## Dependencies Management

- Regular updates of Next.js and React
- Security vulnerability monitoring
- Dependency audit schedule: Monthly
- Version control in package.json

## Deployment Strategy

- Development: Local environment
- Staging: To be set up
- Production: To be determined
- CI/CD: To be implemented

## Performance Goals

- Lighthouse score targets:
  - Performance: 90+
  - Accessibility: 95+
  - Best Practices: 95+
  - SEO: 90+

## Future Considerations
